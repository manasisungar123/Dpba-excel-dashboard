## 📊 Dashboard Components & Analysis

### 1️⃣ Time-Based Slicers (Month & Year)

* Interactive slicers allow users to filter data by **month** and **year (2023 & 2024)**.
* All charts and KPIs update automatically based on the selected time period.

---

### 2️⃣ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs are created using **Pivot Tables** to show high-level ER performance metrics:

* **Number of Patients** – calculated using *Distinct Count*
* **Average Waiting Time** – calculated using *Average function*
* **Patient Satisfaction Score** – shows overall service quality

These KPIs provide a quick summary of ER efficiency and patient experience.

* Bar chart created using **% of Grand Total** in Pivot Table
* Displays the percentage of:

  * Patients **Admitted**
  * Patients **Not Admitted**

**Purpose:**

* Helps understand admission trends and ER load
* Supports decision-making for bed availability and resource planning
